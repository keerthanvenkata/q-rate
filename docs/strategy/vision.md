    - **Redemption**: Scan User's Coupon QR -> Validate & Burn Points.
2.  **Loyalty Logic**:
    - **Balance**: Current spendable points.
    - **Lifetime Score**: Total points earned (historical status).

## The Value Proposition (The "Why")

In Hyderabad’s saturated cafe markets (Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, Financial District), **visibility is the only currency.**

- **Staff-Driven:** Owners have control over the process via their staff.
- **For the Staff:**
  - **Service $\rightarrow$ Reward:** The "Ask" becomes a "Gift" ("Can I send you a free cookie coupon?").
- **For the Customer:**
  - **Zero Friction:** No scanning, no searching. They just receive a message and click.
