# Q-Rate: The Hyderabad Playbook (Market Strategy)

This document outlines the go-to-market strategy for the 2025-2026 pilot in Hyderabad.

## Market Strategy: The Hyderabad Pilot

Hyderabad’s cafe culture is shifting to **experiential, specialty coffee spots** (e.g., _Karafa, Autumn Leaf_). These are our V0 partners.

### Pilot Phase Strategy (Weeks 1-4)

- **Hyper-Local Targeting:** Start with 3 cafes in specific clusters (Madhapur/Kondapur).
- **The "High-Conversion" Operations Model:**
  - **Pricing Strategy:** We accept the **~₹0.12 cost** per template message as a "Cost of Acquisition" (CAC).
  - _Rationale:_ User receives the link directly $\rightarrow$ Higher CTR than QR codes.
  - _Offer:_ First 500 messages free for the cafe to prove ROI.
- **Staff Terminal:** The PWA runs on the existing billing tablet or waiter's phone.

## Operational Strategy: "The Dirty Trick"

To scale without a massive sales team, we use **Product-Led Growth (PLG).**

1.  **Staff Incentives (The "Entry" Metric):** Staff act as the engine. We track "Invites Sent" vs. "Reviews Verified" per staff member.
2.  **The "Unified Identity":** The phone number is the primary key. If a user has a Q-Rate history at Cafe A, they are "Pre-Verified" at Cafe B.
