# Q-Rate Compliance & Operational Rules

## Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2025

India’s **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules** are handled via strict operational protocols:

- **Verbal Consent + Audit Log:**
  - **Process:** Staff asks: "Can I send you a coupon on WhatsApp?"
  - **Audit:** The Staff PWA has a mandatory checkbox: _"Customer gave verbal consent."_ This creates a timestamped digital record linked to the Staff ID.
  - **Policy:** We treat this as "Reasonable Purpose" for a one-time transactional message.

## Review Gating & Google Policies

Google strictly prohibits **incentivizing positive reviews**. To remain compliant:

- **"Feedback Reward" not "Review Reward":** The copy must always say: _"Get a free cookie for sharing your feedback."_
- **The "No-Gate" Logic:**
  - If the user posts a 5-star review $\rightarrow$ Gemini verifies $\rightarrow$ Reward.
  - If the user screenshots a 1-star review or a "complaint" $\rightarrow$ Gemini verifies it's feedback $\rightarrow$ **Reward is still granted.**

## WhatsApp Pricing & Costs

- **Review Hook:** ~₹0.12 (Utility Template). We prioritize this "Paid Nudge" for its superior user experience and conversion rate.
- **Strategy:** High-quality initial onboarding justifies the marginal cost.
